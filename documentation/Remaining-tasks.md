| Implement tracks sorting / filtering                                        | Filtering should be possible by tracks owner. For example a filter could be "my tracks".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Views can be configured to be or not used.                      | The tool needs to provide two layouts, one for annotating and one for presenting. A presentation mode (without insertion, creation, deletion). An annotate mode (with everything)           |
| Add a button "focus on playhead" in timeline controls.          | When the user has moved the focus from the playhead, it should be possible to set it back by pressing a button that will always keep the playhead in the center of the timeline.            |
| Auto-Pause checked by default                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Labels name should not be displayed                             | In the categories/labels editor, timeline and annotations list, by default only the label abbreviation should be used. The label name should be like a description displayed as a tool tip. |
| Scales always displayed if present                              | The scales should now always be displayed in the labels box and not only on rollover. If no scale, the place used by the category will simply be smaller.                                   |
| Collapse unselected annotation                                  | By default all the annotations (or only the structured annotations) in the list should be collapse and selecting them will be open.                                                         |
